- 👋 Hi, I’m Shafayet @mast3rofshadow. Well mast3rofshadow, the reason behind this nickname is nothing particular. It was adopted from a fantasy champion character ZED of a famous 5vs5 pvp game "League of Legends" aka lol. Another reason is I'm introvert type person, kinda unsocial, like our shadow, who stays with us all day long but don't say a thing ever. 

- 👀 I’m interested in Yukisaan, my love, my life. At first I want her then I will be interested in something else...
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Javascript
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on web development field in the upcoming future
- 📫 How to reach me. Easy, Go to your nearest airport and tell any pilot to fly my home in Kita, Japan. They will immediately bring you then to me. LOL. 
okay, no more jokes, you will immediately get me if you mail me on shafayet.mortuza@gmail.com, if you try me over phone then dial JP country code first, which is +81, then add my number 70-3129-5768.
